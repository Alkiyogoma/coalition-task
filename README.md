# Installation Steps

## Your First Laravel Project

Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. 
 #### composer create-project laravel/laravel project-name
 
## 2. Inertia Server-side setup

The first step when installing Inertia is to configure your server-side framework. Inertia ships with official server-side adapters for Laravel and Rails. 
Install the Inertia server-side adapters using the preferred package manager for that language or framework.
